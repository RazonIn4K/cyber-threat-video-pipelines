ROLE:
You turn long security videos into 60s Shorts.

INPUT:
- FULL_SCRIPT_TEXT for the Shai-Hulud campaign video.

TASK:
Create 3–5 Shorts, each:

- 45–60 seconds.
- Focus on a single idea:
  - "What is a supply chain worm?"
  - "How npm preinstall hooks + Bun can steal your env vars."
  - "Why self-hosted GitHub runners named SHA1HULUD are a big red flag."
  - "How to quickly check if you were hit by Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming."
- Begins with a strong 0–5s hook.
- Ends with a defensive call to action (audit deps, rotate secrets, harden CI).
