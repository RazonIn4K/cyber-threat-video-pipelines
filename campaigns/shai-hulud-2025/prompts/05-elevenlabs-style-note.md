# ElevenLabs Voice Style Guide

## Voice Profile Settings
- Assume this will be read by a mid-20s, clear, neutral-accent voice.
- Pace: medium-fast, but slow down on stats and checklists.
- Emphasize key phrases: "supply chain worm", "preinstall hook", "Bun runtime", "self-hosted runner", "rotate your secrets".
- Avoid tongue-twister sentences and long lists without pauses.

## Pronunciation Notes
- "Shai-Hulud" → "shy-huh-LOOD" (from Dune)
- "npm" → spell out "N-P-M"
- "CI/CD" → "C-I-C-D"
- "BYOR" → spell out "B-Y-O-R"

## Pacing Guidelines
- Normal speech: 150-160 words per minute
- Technical explanations: 130-140 words per minute
- Statistics and numbers: pause before and after
- Call-to-actions: slower, emphatic delivery
